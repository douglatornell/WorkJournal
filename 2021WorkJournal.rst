^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Week 46 of UBC work-from-home due to COVID-19

Re-ran a selection of the timing tests in the hindcast-dayavgs-dev notebook with engine="h5netcdf" and found (as usual) that it is *not* faster than netcdf4 (despite the assertion in the xarray docs).
Investigated yesterday's nowcast-agrif failure: inifiband error; re-ran 24jan & 25jan.
Added narrative re: writing netCDF4 files, and buffed sketch of stand-alone script.
