    models, so it's not directly relevant
  * updated bathymetry dataset in summary attributes of rolling forecast datasets
    amd added explanation of lack of versioning

  `ubcSSnBathymetryV17-02` dataset from ERDDAP
  * created issue #323

##### Miscellaneous

* SharcNet seminar: Converting Python code with NumPy to run on the GPU
  * Pawel Pomorski, Waterloo
  * https://helpwiki.sharcnet.ca/wiki/Online_Seminars
  * CuPy, a library highly compatible with NumPy, which offers drop-in replacement for most NumPy
    (and SciPy) functions
    * needs memory management
  * basic techniques used to convert a NumPy program to CuPy
  * cuPyNumeric library from NVIDIA, which allows running NumPy code on the GPU with no code changes
  * GPUs have thousands of cores; appropriate for massively parallel jobs
  * GPUs have separate memory; performance cost due to bandwidth between CPU and GPU
  * eliminate explicit loops
  * example: solve 1D Poisson equation
    * tri-diagonal matrix
    * identity(), reshape() and matrix->vector->matrix dance to construct matrix without explicit loops
    * 16000 x 16000 matrix:
      * <1000 not worthwhile on GPU
      * 89 seconds on 1 core
      * speed up using OMP threads peters out at 8 threads (6.85 s) due to memory access competition
  * CuPy
    * decide what code to run on CPU, and what on GPU
    * x_gpu = cp.asarray(x_cpu)  # move from CPU to GPU
    * x_cpu = cp.asnumpy(x_gpu)  # move from GPU to CPU
    * 0.265 s
  * `nvtop` is `top` for GPUs
    * 100% GPU usage is the beginning of efficient use; want more threads than cores
  * cuPyNumeric
    * no changes to numpy code
    * install via `conda` in an `apptainer` image
    * all code runs on GPU
    * user `legate` as launcher
    * lots of weedy details
    * crashes for 32000 x 32000 test case because it exceeds GPU memory


##### 202405 Bathymetry

* paused work on `tools/bathymetry/Process20405Bathymetry.ipynb`

    to work



#### Thu 30-Jan-2025

##### tools/SalishSeaTools

* continued work on issue #104 re: FutureWarning from pandas re: read_csv() date_parser arg in PR#132
  * added test for bad date format
  * extended stripping of leading/trailing whitespace in `load_tidal_predictions()` to all column
    names
  * refactored time zone conversion to eliminate FutureWarning
  * didn't do `load_observations()` because it call `get_dfo_wlev()` that we know no longer works
* added GHA workflow to automatically add milestone with closest due date to issues and PRs when

Because I can never remember how to get a git feature branch that I set aside back into working
state:

* ref: <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing>
* git switch feature
* git rebase main
* In PyCharm > Git > Log context menu "Rebase 'feature' onto 'main'"
* **BUT** if the changes in the feature branch overlap files in main, it's possible that
  a merge will be required
