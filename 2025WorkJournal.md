    models, so it's not directly relevant
  * updated bathymetry dataset in summary attributes of rolling forecast datasets
    amd added explanation of lack of versioning

  `ubcSSnBathymetryV17-02` dataset from ERDDAP
  * created issue #323

##### Miscellaneous

* SharcNet seminar: Converting Python code with NumPy to run on the GPU
  * Pawel Pomorski, Waterloo
  * https://helpwiki.sharcnet.ca/wiki/Online_Seminars
  * CuPy, a library highly compatible with NumPy, which offers drop-in replacement for most NumPy
    (and SciPy) functions
    * needs memory management
  * basic techniques used to convert a NumPy program to CuPy
  * cuPyNumeric library from NVIDIA, which allows running NumPy code on the GPU with no code changes
  * GPUs have thousands of cores; appropriate for massively parallel jobs
  * GPUs have separate memory; performance cost due to bandwidth between CPU and GPU
  * eliminate explicit loops
  * example: solve 1D Poisson equation
    * tri-diagonal matrix
    * identity(), reshape() and matrix->vector->matrix dance to construct matrix without explicit loops
    * 16000 x 16000 matrix:
      * <1000 not worthwhile on GPU
      * 89 seconds on 1 core
      * speed up using OMP threads peters out at 8 threads (6.85 s) due to memory access competition
  * CuPy
    * decide what code to run on CPU, and what on GPU
    * x_gpu = cp.asarray(x_cpu)  # move from CPU to GPU
    * x_cpu = cp.asnumpy(x_gpu)  # move from GPU to CPU
    * 0.265 s
  * `nvtop` is `top` for GPUs
    * 100% GPU usage is the beginning of efficient use; want more threads than cores
  * cuPyNumeric
    * no changes to numpy code
    * install via `conda` in an `apptainer` image
    * all code runs on GPU
    * user `legate` as launcher
    * lots of weedy details
    * crashes for 32000 x 32000 test case because it exceeds GPU memory


##### 202405 Bathymetry

* paused work on `tools/bathymetry/Process20405Bathymetry.ipynb`

    to work



#### Thu 30-Jan-2025

##### tools/SalishSeaTools

* continued work on issue #104 re: FutureWarning from pandas re: read_csv() date_parser arg in PR#132
  * added test for bad date format
  * extended stripping of leading/trailing whitespace in `load_tidal_predictions()` to all column
    names
  * refactored time zone conversion to eliminate FutureWarning
  * didn't do `load_observations()` because it call `get_dfo_wlev()` that we know no longer works
* added GHA workflow to automatically add milestone with closest due date to issues and PRs when

#### Sun 23-Feb-2025

##### SalishSeaNowcast

* squash-merged PR#337 re: fix for `crop_gribs`
* started to explore how to deal with GRIB2 files producing netCDF files in which all the the time
  stamps are the same (the issue that caused us to pin cfgrib=0.9.11.0 in PR#276)
  * looked at changing `crop_gribs` but decided that `grib_to_netcdf` might be the better place
    to solve the problem
  * need to run `crop_gribs 06 --backfill` with `cfgrib=0.9.15.0` and `xarray=2025.1.1` so that I
    can see what `grib_ds.step` looks like in `grib_to_netcdf`



### Week 9

#### Mon 24-Feb-2025

##### SalishSeaNowcast

* continued to explore how to deal with GRIB2 files producing netCDF files in which all the the time
  stamps are the same (the issue that caused us to pin cfgrib=0.9.11.0 in PR#276)
  * ran `crop_gribs 06 --backfill` with `cfgrib=0.9.15.0` and `xarray=2025.1.1` on `khawla`
    * in `grib_to_netcdf`:
      * `grib_ds.step = [0] * 25`
      * `grib_ds.time = 2025-02-24T06:00:00.000000000`
    * in `grib_to_netcdf` on GRIB files processed with `cfgrib=0.9.11.0` and `xarray=2027.7.0`:
      * `grib_ds.step = [ 61200000000000,  64800000000000  ..., 147600000000000]`
      * `grib_ds.time = 2025-02-23T06:00:00.000000000`
    * discovered that `grib_ds.valid_time` holds the timestamp values that we want, so refactored
      `grib_to_netcdf` to use `grib_ds.valid_time.values` instead of
      `grib_ds.time.values + grib_ds.step.values`



#### Tue 25-Feb-2025

Meeting w/ Michele Blanchet, Cardiac Rehab Dietician

##### SalishSeaCast

* manager crashed when `download_wwatch3_results forecast2` finished because checklist was cleared
  while that worker was running
  * when manager restarted it loaded the hacked version of the config that had uploads to
    `robot.graham` enabled; that caused errors from `upload_forcing`
  * corrected config and restarted manager at ~14:30
* `graham` is finally back online, with the exception of `/nearline`
  * switched to `main` branch and pull updates from GitHub
  * restarted manager to load config with `robot.graham` enabled
  * ran `upload_forcing robot.graham nowcast+ 2024-12-0[789]` and was prompted for MFA
    * emailed support to get restricted ssh access restored; fixed in <~1h!

* backfilled `upload_forcing nowcast+` to `graham`


##### Security Updates

* Squash-merged dependabot PR to update ssh-action to 1.2.1 re: feature update
  * salishsea-site



Update grib_to_netcdf to use `valid_time`

Replaced usages of `step` and `time` with `valid_time` to make our
timestamp processing compatible with non-hourly step handling that
was introduced in `cfgrib=0.9.12.0`. Adjusted preprocessing, data
array creation, and coordinate handling to align with this change.

This change removes the need for version pinning of `cfgrib=0.9.11.0`
that was introduced in PR#276. By doing that, issue #336 is resolved.



#### Wed 26-Feb-2025

Installed new gen 3 modem from Rogers; booster pod won't connect to it, but signal was strong enough

* prep failed due to no new wind data
* debugging on `khawla`:
  * last wind data date at ~10:15 is 2025-03-11; i.e. ECCC wind obs aren't updating for previous day
    before we try to run at 09:30
  * wateroffice web page table layout has changed from 4 columns to 5
  * successfully hacked code to:
    * suppress noisy info and debug messages from matplotlib
    * successfully process rivers obs
    * calculate an 11mar25 bloom date forecast

##### SalishSeaNowcast

* squash-merged PR#345 re: renamed `make_*runoff_file` workers to make 201702 for `nowcast-agrif`
  the special one, and the one we now use for everything else the one that will become generic after
  some refactoring to handle bathymetry as a CLI arg/option
* released v25.1


##### Miscellaneous

* MOAD group mtg; see whiteboard
* Phys Ocgy seminar: Patagonia field school
* read the Real Python `asyncio` tutorial
  * unclear if it will work for concurrent ERDDAP obs matching or if `xarray.open_dataset()`
    will block
  * `xarray.open_dataset()` blocks, so strike the `asyncio` approach

##### SalishSeaNowcast

* continued work on replacing mock loggers in tests with caplog re: issue #82
  * branch: caplog-fixture




* tools repo TODO:
  * update library_code section in docs or move it to MOAD docs


* create mesh mask for sss150


* add --backfill option download_weather to allow over-write of existing destination dir
  * issue #309


Refresh myself on Fortran in VS Code and on-the-fly compilation; prep to present to group.

* fortran.fortls.directories


* Update project name retrieval in `conf.py`:
  * branch: get-project-name
  <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
  ```python
  import tomllib
  from pathlib import Path

  ...

  with Path("../pyproject.toml").open("rb") as f:
      pkg_info = tomllib.load(f)
  project = pkg_info["project"]["name"]
  ```
  <!-- markdownlint-enable MD013 -->
  <!-- markdownlint-disable MD013 -->
  ```text
  Chg to project name retrieval from pyproject.toml

  Replaced the hardcoded project name with dynamic retrieval from
  `pyproject.toml` using `tomllib`. This ensures consistency and
  reduces manual updates for project metadata.
  ```

Because I can never remember how to get a git feature branch that I set aside back into working
state:

* ref: <https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing>
* git switch feature
* git rebase main
* In PyCharm > Git > Log context menu "Rebase 'feature' onto 'main'"
* **BUT** if the changes in the feature branch overlap files in main, it's possible that
  a merge will be required
