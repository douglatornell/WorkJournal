**Statutory Holiday** - New Year's Day lieu day

Installed PyCharm 2022.3.1 on khawla.

collect_river_data is not collecting Roberts Creek; best guess is that manager needed to be
restarted to get Roberts Creek into its config, so did that.

Started researching how to get USGS river discharge data into automation:
* https://waterservices.usgs.gov/
* messed around with WaterML and owslib but just got frustrated by XML, SOAP-ish services
  and bad code/docs
* decided to use httpx and json
* discussed error handling w/ Susan
  * enable follow_redirects for httpx.get()
  * don't do tenacity.retry()
  * log an error if there is not data added to obs file
  * Susan will enable make_runoff_file to handle missing obs by persistence or fitting,
    depending on the river

Investigated security alert on python-future:
* pkg seems unmaintained; recommendation is to drop it because it is from 2to3 Earth
* used by numpy-indexed which we install explicitly, due to use by OPPTools
  * numpy-indexed last commit was 22-Jan-2019; Python versions listed are 2.7 and 3.5;
    unmaintained??
  * numpy-indexed is imported in OPPTools.general_utilities.mut **but use is commented out**
    so I can probably work around it in my fork
* used by commonmark due it being a dependency for rich
  * commonmark is archived; recommended alternative is markdown-it-py
  * rich has 5-month-old PR#2439 that switches from commonmark to markdown-it-py
Continued work on adding USGS rivers collect_river_data:
branch: add-usgs-rivers
PR#143

  * resolved by running ``reshapr extract`` on salish
* apr14
  * 28apr14 physics is another case of make_averaged_dataset worker just hanging
Created ``/results2/SalishSea/month-avg.202111/day_avg.py`` to run ``reshapr extract`` on salish
and rename resulting file correctly
* may14
  * 27may14 biology is another case of make_averaged_dataset worker just hanging

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Worked at ESB while Rita was at home.

Discussion of Python modules & functions w/ Karyn & Raisha; see 
``analysis-doug/notebooks/mods_and_funcs/``

Finished adding USGS rivers collect_river_data:
branch: add-usgs-rivers
PR#143; rebase-merged
* USGS rivers successfully collected in production after collect_weather 12 finished
* switched back to main branch on skookum, pulled changes, and restarted manager to ensure
  that update config takes effect
Released v22.1 (first release since 19.1!!) and bumped version to 23.1.dev0 for next dev cycle.
Triaged issues to clean up some stale ones and move some to 23.1 milestone.

SharcNet webinar re: future Canadian ARC directions & performance:
Mark Hahn, McMaster
* dies/chiplets make up packages/sockets
* cache line = 64 bytes; nothing happens on less than a cache line, in contrast to conceptual
  byte addressable memory
* more cores, higher burst clock speeds, larger L3 cache (Intel is limited), higher memory bandwidth
* core-seconds vs. cores (as I have done) is a good way to view scaling performance
* all broadwell nodes going away in next year; slow
* tradeoffs around usage profiles:
  * CPU vs. GPU
  * compact vs. memory-intensive
* Intel has been stuck at 14 nm fabs
* AMD reinvented itself:
  * chiplets win due to better yields than large chips
  * 7 & 5 nm fab from TSMC
* Intel Sapphire Rapids introduced yesterday (4th gen Xenon) uses chiplets
  * possible memory in chiplet; terabyte memory bandwidth
  * very hot: 350W TPD; systems designed for 140W
* AMD next will be Genoa w/ 96 core; also 360W hot
  * huge cache in pkg
  * beyond that 128 cores w/ smaller L3 cache; 256 core per node @ 250W
* no likely hardware updates this year due to funding and proposal lead time
* graham broadwell nodes are from Huawei (political optics),
  power dissipation per core is 2x Skylake, out of warranty
* local SSD use is variable among workloads
* new SSD approach memory speed
* think about:
  * NEMO w/o MPI for fat nodes
  * XIOS and node-local SSD

Continued backfilling day & month avg files using ``nowcast.workers.day_month_avgs.py`` module.
jul15 is the beginning of a section of runs where automation produced 1d files with ``time``
coordinate name instead of ``time_counter``; removed check for 1d file from ``day_month_avgs.py``
to force extraction of 1d files with ``time_counter``
* jul15 success

Ruff: Faster Python Linting With Rust
Charlie Marsh
Staff Software Engineer at Spring Discovery
* recent Talk Python podcast
* recent PyCharm blog post
* fast linter & fixer
* rust niches
  * performance
  * interop w/ Python is really good
    * PyO3 ecosystem
    * Rust crates can be published to PyPI
* Ruff is on conda-forge
* replaces "Flake8 (plus a variety of plugins), isort, pydocstyle, yesqa, 
  and even a subset of pyupgrade and autoflake" (from conda-forge description)
* embedded docs in ruff; e.g.
    ``ruff rule F541``
* autofix capability:
    ``ruff --fix ...``
    * *caution* can break code; code transformation is a hard problem
* can be configured in ``pyproject.toml``
* number of violations of each rule
    ``ruff --statistics``
* can add ``# noqa`` comments to silence notifications to get to clean state
    ``ruff --add-noqa``
* no plugin support at present due to early state and not ready to define public API
* discussion of rust-python; ruff uses r-p's AST parser
* ruff is designed to be used along-side black
* building an auto-formatter integrated into ruff
* PyCharm plugin: called Ruff, community built, in marketplace
* design intent is that ruff is to be used a la carte
  * pick and choose sub-linters
  * ``ruff linters`` shows sub-linters and their rule prefixes
* **pyupgrade <-- investigate** by Anthony Sottle> of pre-commit
* "fearless parallelization" in rust
* avoid allocation in rust for performance
* **ruff doesn't support structural pattern matching**
* works with pre-commit

Got suggestions from Becca and Jose re: gribs and contact with Tim Chui, their TA in Roland's
numerical weather forecasting course.
Continued work on cfgrib-grib_to_netcdf.ipynb:
* added narrative on yesterday's work
* created functions to build NEMO forcing conformant xarray dataset from a range of hours of a
  gribs forecast tree; i.e. 00Z 06Z, etc.
* email discussion w/ Tim Chui lead to Salem package; interesting, but not directly useful
* Susan came up with trigonometry to transform wind components to earth-referenced

Explored CaSPAr (https://github.com/julemai/CaSPAr/wiki/Home) to obtain missing HRDPS files:
* files are netCDF
* variables probably have different names
  see: https://github.com/julemai/CaSPAr/wiki/Connection-between-CaSPAr-and-MSC-Datamart
* variables that may not be available:
  * wiki list is for RPDS, and it only shows 16 variables on CaSPAr,
    but https://github.com/julemai/CaSPAr/wiki/Available-products says there are 55 RDPS variables
    (and 50 HRDPS)
  * PRATE_SFC_0  # precipitation rate at ground level (for VHFR FVCOM)
  * DSWRF_SFC_0  # accumulated downward shortwave (solar) radiation at ground level
  * SPFH_TGL_2   # specific humidity at 2m elevation
      SPFH_SFC_0 instead, but with note: 
      "Discrepancy with ECCC dictionary: dictionary says it is a 2m variable"
  * RH_TGL_2     # relative humidity at 2m elevation (for VHFR FVCOM)
* instructions say:
    "After that you will need to download and install the app Globus Connect Personal on your machine."
  but I will see if I can get it to work with the graham Globus endpoint so that we can see an
  HRDPS file
* used Compute Canada is to log in to Globus; had to disable Firefox Enhanced Tracking Protection
* registered CaSPAr account
* variable names are way different

  pkill -f collect_weather
  collect_weather 18 2.5km
  bash /results/forcing/rivers/observations/collect_river_data.sh 2023-03-20
  make_turbidity_file
  collect_NeahBay_ssh 06
  download_live_ocean
  launch_remote_worker salish-nowcast grib_to_netcdf "nowcast+"
  * failed because I curl-ed the wrong file
  upload_forcing arbutus nowcast+
collect_weather 18 2.5km finished correctly when all files hae been downloaded :-)

(SalishSeaCast)

Continued work on restoring next_workers to restore more automation steps:
* upload_forcing after make_live_ocean_files
* run_ww3 forecast after wwatch3 nowcast
* cleaned up commented out code in next_workers
* Skip launch of nowcast-dev test during HRDPS catch-up
Changed to run grib_to_netcdf on salish so it can use the persistent dask cluster and lots of
memory there:
* branch: grib_to_netcdf-on-salish
* PR#167
Changed watchdog observer thread management in collect_weather:
branch watdog-2.1.7
PR#168
* replaced time.sleep(1) with observer.join(timeout=1)
* dropped some no longer needed os.fspath() calls

Wed 22-Mar-2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixed run-date passing for wwatch3-forecast2
* fixed in branch; fix-ww3-fcst2-run-date
* uploaded to skookum for test tomorrow
* created py311 branch  
  * added 3.11 to python-version matrices of pytest-with-coverage and sphinx-linkcheck
    and let GHA chew on them; both were successful
  * researched mamba-org/provision-with-micromamba as an alternative to 
    conda-incubator/setup-miniconda
    * claims to be faster
    * has environment caching feature with default 1-day TTL
    * tested in pytest-with-coverage; works, but workflow execution was slower than previous one
(SalishSeaNowcast)

Automation worked as expected with the following issues:
* wwatch3-forecast2 failed due to incorrect run-date passing
  * fixed in branch; uploaded to skookum for test tomorrow
* nowcast-blue comparison figs failed; probably due to no nowcast-dev runs?
* figures/research/velocity_section_and_surface.py failed with IndexError
* run_NEMO_agrif failed due to backfill not done
* figures/publish/storm_surge_alerts_thumbnail.py and others failed due to 
  hard-coded ops_*.nc filename template
  * need to fix in salishsea_tools/wind_tools
dask cluster on salish did not appear to leak memory as I was seing earlier

Helped Karyn with loading datasets from Susan's sockeye carbon runs.
Helped Cassidy with ssh key on graham via CCDB.

Fixed run-date passing for wwatch3-forecast2
* fixed in branch; fix-ww3-fcst2-run-date
* worked as expected overnight
* PR#171; rebase-merged
Changed codeql-analysis workflow to trigger on push to main and pull requests
targeting main; trying to resolve warning re:

    .github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yaml:analyze/language:python
(SalishSeaNowcast)

Restarted nowcast-dev in automation:
* on khawla:
  * restored ``make_forcing_links salish nowcast+ --shared-storage`` in after_watch_NEMO
  * copied to skookum to test, and restarted manager to load
* on salish:
    mkdir /results/SalishSea/nowcast-dev.201905/22mar23/

Fri 24-Mar-2023
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Created ``forcing/atmospheric/continental2.5/nemo_forcing/`` directories on graham-dtn
and optimum; moved ``hrdps_*.nc`` files uploaded by automation to ``GEM2.5/operational/``
Tried to investigate dask scheduler high and increasing memory use without much luck,
other than it appears to be a known issue that the devs don't udnerstand.
Restarted dask cluster scheduler and workers; reduced reserved memory, but no change in swap.
Backfilled ``upload_forcing nowcast+`` to graham-dtn and optimum-hindcast via bash loops
``make_plots nemo forecast publish`` failed with:
  arrow.parser.ParserError: Could not match input '01-Jan-1970 00:00' to any of the following 
  formats: YYYY-MMM-DD HH:mm:ss, DD-MMM-YYYY HH:mm:ss, YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss.
in salishsea_tools.nc_tools.time_origin()

* got stalled by permissions on 
``/home/sallen/MEOPAR/`` preventing me from creating new storage tree:
/home/sallen/MEOPAR/continental2.5/NEMO-atmos/fcst; fixed
(SalishSeaCast)

Updated atmospheric forcing paths on optimum-hindcast and graham-dtn in config & unit tests;
Copied config to skookum for testing after grib_to_netcdf nowcast+; confirmed that uploads 
were stored as expected.
Updated atmospheric forcing paths in figure dev & test notebooks
nowcast-dev launched by automation, so committed and puished code to resume nowcast-dev runs after 
HRDPS catch-up.
(SalishSeaNowcast)

Search of SalishSeaCast org shows that only uses of 
salishsea_tools.wind_tools.calc_wind_avg_at_point() are in SalishSeaNowcast and analysis-vicky;
decided to just change hard-coded weather filename templte from ``ops_`` to ``hrdps_`` instead
of trying to generalize; copied planned change to skookum for use by
``make_plots nemo forecast publish``.
Added 'DD-MMM-YYYY HH:mm' to arrow.get() parser patterns in salishsea_tools.nc_tools.time_origin()
to handle ``hrdps_*.nc`` files.
(SalishSeaTools)

GitHub RSA key rotation issue hit Susan on a pull, then me on a push; replacement key I got was

dask scheduler held virtual memory is up to 29.371G after 6 runs of grib_to_netcdf.
Continued work on resuming nowcast-agrif runs:
* tried to pull grid repo updates;faield with "fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly"
  * initially due to github.com host key change - fixed
  * next due to id_rsa key on oricnus that is not on GitHub; installed id_rsa.pub on GitHub

  * gave up
* rsync-ed HRDPS continental interpolation weights files to orcinus
* launched 1st backfill run:

* ran GRIB cropping notebook call for 20230329/06 hours 17 to 41 to make cropped grib files
  that are needed to build run_date + 1 fcst/hrdps_*.nc file
  * took 11m20.1s to process 25x11 = 275 files on khawla with /results mounted by sshfs

* can monitor time since previous file downloaded
* scanned sarracenia logs for duration of gaps during download sessions
  * >45 min is not uncommon somewhere around hour 010 since yesterday afternoon's restart
collect_weather 18 had collected only 399 files at 16:15 when hour 048 was full;
* lots of missing files in hours 015-022, 028-036, and 039
collect_weather 00 had only collected 492 files at ~22:00; missing around hours 020
* fixed via the usual dance

Tidied up refactoring collect_weather to handle missing file messages by switching

* branch: robust-collect_weather
* **not pushed to GitHub**
* on hold because the issue went away after 25-Apr change to use queues on dd.weather instead of
  hpfx due to impending hpfx server maintenance outage; continned using dd.weather queues after
  hpfx maintenance because missing file messages problem was not present
Made sarracenia change to use queues on dd.weather official:
* branch: sarracenia-dd-weather
* PR#180
* changed to branch on skookum and restarted sarracenia clients to test
  * hydrometric file downloads worked correctly after restart
  * HRDPS continental file downloads worked correctly after restart

* last work was 22-Feb before HRDPS flipped to continental grid
* branch: v202111-rivers
* PR#150
* resolved merge conflicts that GitHub was showing in branch:
  * updated envs/requirements.txt
  * cherry-picked yesterday's supervisord.ini changes to use dd.weather servers
* added _calc_runoff_dataset() to do part of the work of write_file()

COVID RAT test looked negative after 15 minutes, but I noticed a very faint positive line an
hour or more later.

Continued work on migrating Susan's new rivers processing code into repo:
* last work was 22-Feb before HRDPS flipped to continental grid
* branch: v202111-rivers
* PR#150
* refactored the remainder of write_file() into _write_netcdf() and _to_netcdf() patterned after
  those I wrote in grib_to_netcdf worker; latter isolates actual file write so that it can be 
  mocked for testing of the rest of _write_netcdf() functionality
* started thinking about how to proceed to including this work in make_runoff_file worker:
  * PR#150 is big and branched almost 3 months ago, though GitHub says it is can merge without
    conflicts now
  * discussion with Susan concluded that it would be good to be able to run versions of 
    make_runoff_file in automation for both v201702 and v202108 bathymetires
  * maybe squash-merged PR#150, then start a new branch & PR to create make_v202108_runoff_file
    from make_runoff_file?

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

upload_forcing forecast2 failed due to no runoff files; discussed with Susan and decided to 
restore make_runoff_file and make_v202111_runoff_file after collect_weather 06, then let them
update the runoff files after collect_weather 12
make_runoff_file failed due to missing b202108 key in ``monthly climatology``
upload_forcing nowcast+ launched immediately from make_live_ocean_files instead of waiting for
grib_to_netcdf to finish, so it faailed
* recovery:
  * hacked make_runoff_file to use only b201702 key in ``monthly climatology``; copied it to
    skookum and re-ran it
  * manually ran upload_forcing nowcast+ to restart automation

checklist, then UBC for afternoon evening to test "live at UBC" scheme.
* Platform 7 for Coffee
* London Drugs and new Gandi's hardware location for TP holder
* library for WiFi

Discussed atmos forcing datasets on ERDDAP with Susan; agreed that HRDPS continental lon/lat grid
needs to be a separate dataset; need to decide if it is v2111 or v2.
Also discussed doing erddap-datasets repo overhaul concurrently:
* initially:
  * split ``datasets.xml`` into 1 file per dataset description
  * add script to assemble dataset descriptions into ``datasets.xml``
* longer term:
  * GitHub Actions workflows:
    * validate dataset descriptions XML - maybe
    * assemble ``datasets.xml`` as build artifact
    * deploy ``datasets.xml`` and ``setup.xml`` to skookum, bracketted by tomcat stop/start
* researched:
  * XML parsing and validation:
    * https://realpython.com/python-xml-parser/
    * schema validation is out, I think, because there is no ERDDAP schema and I don't want to
      create one
    * stdlib xml.etree.ElementTree or lxml (same API) should do the job
      * does success of ElementTree.parse() guarantee well-formed XML?
  * https://github.com/7yl4r/erddap-config-template

Dug into test_collect_river_data errors in pytest-with-coverage GHA workflow that were not
appearing in dev env:
* httpx=0.24 changed from custom logging to standard Python logging levels, so it is more

* decided that the messages it provides are worthwhile at the DEBUG level,
  so changed caplog.records index numbers in tests to look at messages from worker that come
  after those from httpx

  exceptions when the XML is not well-formed; so, it can be used for the level of
  XML validation that I had in mind
* added build_datasets_xml.py script

Tried to use latest 5jul HRDPS 12Z tarball from ECCC:
* files are much larger than those downloaded from hpfx, all var files are same size
* Susan gleaned that the files may contain all? levels of atmospheric model
* sent email to Amadou
Started to hack 5jul handling of files we got from hpfx to run nowcast runs only:

* ran ``crop_gribs 12 --fcst-date 2023-07-05 --debug``
* hacked grib_to_netcdf to produce only ``hrdps_y2023m07d05.nc``
* ran ``grib_to_netcdf nowcast+ --run-date 2023-07-05 --debug``

NEMO forecast2 failed overnight; Susan investigated: 1st time step, high velocity components
on western boundary; may not affect nowcast runs because they are initialized from 
yesterday's nowcast-green restart file, whereas forecast2 is initialized from a restart file
generated part way through the forecast run.

More analysis of last night's crop_gribs FileNotFoundError failure leads me to 
conclude that it was crop_gribs 06 failing to launch, not crop_gribs 00 failing;
there is a potential race conditions between collect_weather and crop_gribs re:
the creation of the /results/forcing/atmospheric/continental2.5/GRIB/yyyymmdd/hh/ directory;
if collect_weather doesn't get it created before crop_gribs starts to observe it, the latter
fails; created issue #197

Reverted yesterday's addition of -O to ncks command in make_ww3_current_file that extracts 1st 24h 
of currents forecast during forecast2 prep; it is only applicable when output file
exists; that's not true in normal processing :-(

Refresh myself on Fortran in VS Code and on-the-fly compilation; prep to present to group.




TODO:

Because I can never remember how to get a git feature branch that I set aside back into working
state:
* ref: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing
* git switch feature
* git rebase main
* In PyCharm > Git > Log context menu "Rebase 'feature' onto 'main'"
* **BUT** if the changes in the feature branch overlap files in main, it's possible that
  a merge will be required

    chunk and silence this warning, set the option
        >>> with dask.config.set(**{'array.slicing.split_large_chunks': False}):
        ...     array[indexer]

    To avoid creating the large chunks, set the option

        ...     array[indexer]
      return self.array[key]

Reshapr ideas:
* extraction config examples in docs:
  * simple whole field extraction for a few variables
  * temporal and spatial selection
  * resampling
* extraction from month-avg datasets; issue #32
  * need to handle month-by-month dataset files 
    (e.g. SalishSeaCast_1m_ptrc_T_20220301_20220331.nc); 
    code presently assumes day-by-day
