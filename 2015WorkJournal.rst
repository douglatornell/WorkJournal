*****************
2015 Work Journal
*****************

This is my public work journal.
It is patterned after one that I have kept for several years for my work at Nordion_.
This journal is about:

* my work as a Research Software Engineer with `Dr. Susan Allen`_ in the `Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences`_ at the `University of British Columbia`_
* my freelance work via my consulting business,
  `43ravens`_
* my `open-source activities`_

There was a hiatus in my journalling between Fri 17-Oct-2014 and Wed 27-May-2015 - sorry!
