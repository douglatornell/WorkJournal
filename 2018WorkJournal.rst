2018 Work Journal
*****************

This is my public work journal.
It is patterned after one that I have kept for several years for my work at Nordion_.
This journal is about:

* my work as a Research Software Engineer with `Dr. Susan Allen`_ in the `Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences`_ at the `University of British Columbia`_
* my freelance work via my consulting business,
  `43ravens`_
* my `open-source activities`_

Week 1

Mon 1-Jan-2018
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Statutory Holiday** - New Year's Day

Travel home from Parksville

Fixed bug in make_live_ocean_files re: file name template as Path instead of string.
Discovered that netcdf4-1.2.4 supports opening datasets from Path instances.
After a long thrash, got to the bottom of make_live_ocean_files seemingly creating the file for the previous day - it's due to writing to a symlink created by make_forcing_links when the previous day's make_live_ocean_files fails.

Tue 2-Jan-2018
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

upload_forcing make symlink to 01jan18 LiveOcean files, as expected; moved it aside, but need to figure out how to force make_live_ocean_files to overwite it with a file instead of writing to it.
Changed make_live_ocean_files to delete any existing symlink with the name of the file to be generated for the present day.
