Doug Latornell's Work Journal
*****************************

This is my public work journal.
It is patterned after one that I have kept for several years for my work at Nordion_.
This journal is about my work as a Research Associate with `Dr. Susan Allen`_ in the `Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences`_ at the `University of British Columbia`_ during our sabbatical which started on 1 July 2013.
It is also about my `open-source activities`_.

The markup is reStructuredText_ with Sphinx_ extensions.
