January
=======

Week 1
------

Mon 4-Jan-2016
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* refactor, unit tests & docs for forcing links checking for NEMO-3.6
* update quick-start docs re: NEMO-3.6 - Elise???
* finish run_NEMO36 unit tests

Restarted nowcast mgr after end-of-day to enable automation of PMV feed.
Finished enough implementation of run_NEMO36 worker that it should be able to run nowcast-green on salish; figured out how to paraeterize unit tests re: absolute paths in run description; lots of other unit tests need to be written.
